## Problem Statement Code: 
> ## SIH1522 (Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO))
> ### Development of UT (user terminal) to UT Voice, Image, Video and Data Communication APP (Android or iOS) using Bluetooth 2.0 or above wireless interface and custom protocol.
> Two-way voice, video and data Communication between two UTs through BLE (Bluetooth) needs to be addressed using Custom Protocol (with minimum signalling overheads). The APP should establish a BLE connection among peer UT as part of initialization and thereafter carry out full-duplex communication using a custom protocol format viz- Header Payload. The size of header should not be more than 1/8th of Payload size and the delay/latency in voice or data communication should be less than 200ms. The header should contain a Unique word with advanced features so as to facilitate synchronization with minimal false detection probability. It is expected that the application uses a standard ITU vocoder and maintains a constant transfer rate between UTâ€™s. This is an essential feature for the end application. UI- The UI should have options for voice, Image, Video or data transfer. It is also expected to have a built-in dialer, contact list wherein each UT is assigned a unique ID/Contact ID through which communication could be established. Note- The custom protocol and sample data will be made available after proposal evaluation.
